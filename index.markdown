## A free Fitzwilliam Museum exhibition hosted 7 March - 4 June 2017

Peer through the keyhole of the Italian Renaissance home and discover a hidden world of religious devotion. Bringing together a wealth of objects, including jewellery, ceramics, books, sculptures and paintings, this five-star critically acclaimed exhibition invites us into a domestic sphere that was charged with spiritual significance. Against a background of stunning works of art, humble and everyday artefacts are displayed from across the Italian peninsula. Transforming our understanding of a period that is often cast as intensely worldly and secular, the exhibition brings a new appreciation of the relationship between the material and the divine.

This exhibition is the result of four years of European-funded cross-disciplinary work carried out by the Italian Department, the Faculties of History, Architecture and History of Art at the University of Cambridge, and incorporates their latest research.
