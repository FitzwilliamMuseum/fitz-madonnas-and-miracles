Spain, Valencia, Manises (probably), c.1430–80

tin-glazed earthenware (maiolica)


This jar, decorated with the IHS (a form of Christ’s name), is similar to the one in the painting by Joos van Cleve displayed nearby. Desire for the most beautiful and fashionable religious goods drove trade across Europe and beyond. Spanish maiolica was greatly valued in Italy. When displayed in the home, a jar like this therefore signalled both piety and good taste.
