Book of hours, use of Rome

Ancona, third quarter of 15th century parchment

Binding: 16th century

brown leather over pasteboards, spine re-backed in France, c.1800

The illuminations in this beautiful book of hours were painted in Ancona by the Florentine painter Antonio da Firenze, probably for a member of the local elite, Leonardo Ferretti, whose name and coat-of-arms appear in the volume. The book contains texts in Latin — such as the calendar, hours, psalms, and gospel readings — for use in his private devotions.

Cambridge, The Fitzwilliam Museum,

Bequeathed by Viscount Fitzwilliam, 1816
