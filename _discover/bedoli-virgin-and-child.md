Girolamo Mazzola Bedoli, Virgin and Child

Parma, mid-16th century

red chalk, pen and brown ink on paper

Artists often made preparatory studies of the Virgin and Child using their own family members as models. This fluent red-chalk drawing shows the Virgin as a young mother seated on the ground in a voluminous dress, with a fidgety toddler perched precariously on her knee. Born in Parma, the artist was a near contemporary of the more famous painter Francesco Mazzola, known as Parmigianino.
