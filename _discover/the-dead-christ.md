Florence, c.1432â€“34 pen and brown ink, brown wash, red wash and lead white on paper

This moving drawing invites quiet and prolonged contemplation. Christ appears suspended, floating in the neutral space of the paper in a scene that is sorrowful but peaceful. Flashes of brilliant red vividly recall the piercing of his flesh. The figure is copied from a large altarpiece by the same artist, indicating how images could create links between the church and home.
