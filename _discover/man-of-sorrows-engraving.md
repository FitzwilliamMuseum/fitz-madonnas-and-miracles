Unknown engraver, The Man of Sorrows with an Angel and the Instruments of the Passion

Italy, c.1490–1520

This engraving encompasses the entire narrative of Christ’s Passion in a single image. As the viewer’s gaze moves around the print, it takes in all the objects that featured in the story of Christ’s agony and humiliation, prompting contemplation of his suffering and ultimate sacrifice for humankind. The weeping angel who cradles Christ’s lifeless form provides an additional emotional cue for the beholder.

Cambridge, The Fitzwilliam Museum, P.184-1943
