Virgin and Child

Umbria, Orvieto (possibly), c.1350–1450

tin-glazed earthenware (maiolica)

This statuette of the nursing Virgin is a rare survival of the kind of devotional image that would have graced many a humble home. The Virgin is stately and imposing, yet offers a reassuringly human image of motherhood; she and the Christ Child both wear everyday green-striped skirts, and have no haloes to mark them out as holy.

Cambridge, The Fitzwilliam Museum, EC.2-1938

Given by Mrs W.D. Dickson, 1938
