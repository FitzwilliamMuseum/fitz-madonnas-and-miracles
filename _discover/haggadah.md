Riva di Trento: Yaʾakov Markariyah, 321 [1561]
Book

The Hagadah is a liturgical text read aloud at home during the Seder, the meal that is the climax of the Passover festival. It tells the story of the Jews’ exodus from slavery in Egypt. This edition was printed in 1561 by a press owned by the Cardinal of Trent, Cristoforo Madruzzo, who promoted the publication of Jewish books.
