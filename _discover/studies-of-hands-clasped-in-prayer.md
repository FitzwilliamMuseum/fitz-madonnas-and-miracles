Follower of Federico Barocci,

Italy, later 16th century

Black, red, white and brown chalks on blue paper

This drawing concentrates on one element of a larger composition – a pair of praying hands. Federico Barocci, one of the foremost artists of his day, produced highly finished preparatory drawings, suffused with an air of naturalism and spiritual sweetness. This follower has adopted Barocci’s innovative use of coloured chalks and tinted paper to create an exceptionally beautiful and lifelike study.


Cambridge, The Fitzwilliam Museum
