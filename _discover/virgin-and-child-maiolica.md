Deruta, c.1600–1700

tin-glazed earthenware (maiolica)

This rectangular plaque has two holes at the top, suggesting that the image originally hung on a wall. The heavenly colours of blue, gold and white, as well as the starry background and the angels holding crowns, remind the viewer that, according to Catholic tradition, the Virgin was crowned ‘Queen of Heaven’ after her death. The Child is shown entwined in her golden veil.
