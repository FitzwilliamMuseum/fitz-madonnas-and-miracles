Studio of Sandro Botticelli, Virgin and Child

Florence, c.1480–90

oil on panel

Her eyes lowered to a devotional book, the Madonna cradles her chubby son, who reaches his little arms around her neck and presses his face to hers. Botticelli’s studio in Florence produced many of these fashionable circular religious paintings for people’s homes. Workshop productions made paintings associated with masters such as Botticelli affordable to a wider range of consumers.

Cambridge, The Fitzwilliam Museum

Bequeathed by Charles Brinsley Marlay, 1912
