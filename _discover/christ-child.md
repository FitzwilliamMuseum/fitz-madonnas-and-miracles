Workshop of Andrea della Robbia, The Christ Child

Florence, c.1490-1510

glaze kiln fired clay (terracotta


This life-size figure of Christ as a toddler, his hand raised in blessing, could have been placed above a doorway. His graceful pose and serene expression contrast with the realism of his chubby legs. A faint pinkish glow from the terracotta, visible through the brilliant white glaze, makes Christâ€™s presence in human form seem even more plausible.
